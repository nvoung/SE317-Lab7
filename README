READ ME

To deploy and set up the program simply un-zip the folder in any IDE that runs java. From here you can navigate to the main
class and run the program from here. The program includes all the requriements listed in the LAB 7 assignment and is
fairly simple to run and use. To use the calculator just interact with the MVC interface that is brought up when the 
program is ran.
There is also some input that will be returned to the console, this is just debug logs that helped me figure out why my Memory was 
having problems and where I needed to implement fixes.
